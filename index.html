      <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enchancement</h2>
      <p>
        Progressive Enchancement to me means enhancing the content on websites, and making it more up to date. Progressive enhancment is super important for modern web, it makes webpages more exciting for the clients/viewers to look at and interact with. As well as making it run smoother.

      <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        During this assignment I had trouble putting the images on the dragon homepage, the images were not sizing correctly so only one image is on my dragon homepage before the revise. I had my wife look over the dragon assingment and she explained to me that it would look better if the other two images were added to the homepage of dragon then it would look more complete and fuller. Overall the assignment was very fun to complete and make, Any issues that occured during my time making the assignment I would go reflect back to Professor Wallaces homepage and look at the links provided to help with any issues I had. During this semester I really enjoyed all the articles and links provided on the course homepage to better help understand the assingments for that week. I really enjoyed all the HTML lessons, html was super simple to pick up on and fun to learn. Something I would have done diffrently, would have been to use codepen alot more to type out my html & css before applying it to aws. My experience this semester learning html,css, and js has been exciting. I didnt know how any of these programs worked before this semester, and very little about computers. After this semester I have a strong understanding of it all now. Each lesson was fun and easy to understand.
